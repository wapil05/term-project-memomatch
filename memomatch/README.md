This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Montserrat, a custom Google Font.

## Partykit server

Run the following command in your terminal in your projectâ€™s directory to start the partykit dev server:

```bash
npx partykit dev
```

The Game Setup is based on this [Example](https://docs.partykit.io/examples/starter-kits/game-starter-nextjs-redux/).
